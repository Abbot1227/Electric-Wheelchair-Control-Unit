# Electric-Wheelchair-Control-Unit

Our group project is dedicated to the design of a digital system of electric wheelchair
control unit. Circuit for that was designed in Logisim with standard library. In addition
to that, several counters, timer, and binary-to-7-segment decoder were designed in
order to ensure desired work of the system. The system also includes IDLE - mode,
which allows the wheelchair to save energy when not in use. After constructing
circuit, operation and behavior of the system was tested, and performance was
assessed.
